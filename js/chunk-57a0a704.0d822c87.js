Under \'Plan\', you can use Vulcan to develop implementation specific guidance from more general guides (like STIGs from SRGs) or choose to use pre-existing guidance like DISA STIGs, CIS Benchmarks, or Vendor Security Checklists.  Under \'Harden\', you can use infrastructure-as-code or configuration management software like Ansible, Progress Chef, Puppet, or Terraform - many scripts are already created and available for use.  Under \'Validate\', you can use the SAF CLI to generate InSpec profiles stubs that can then be refined manually.  Once you have created those profiles or found the many profiles already created and available for use, you can use InSpec to generate Heimdall Data Format (HDF) output via the JSON reporter.  You can also use various other 3rd party tools to get scan results.  Under \'Normalize\', you can take the results of those 3rd party scans and convert them into HDF via the SAF CLI.  Under \'Visualize\', you can view HDF within Heimdall.  You can also use the SAF CLI to generate and view other information such as how the results compare against previously generated thresholds.  Additionally, you can view scan results in other applications after conversion and upload by the SAF CLI or Emasser."}},{"name":"Mature DevSecOps Best Practices","tag":"dso","desc":"DevSecOps is a software development framework that stresses automation and rapid user feedback to deliver quality, secure software quickly.
